Programming Languages

Course Description: Exploration of the design space of programming languages via an in-depth study of two programming languages, one functional and one object-oriented; focuses on idiomatic uses of each language and on features characteristic for each language. 

Notes: Main takeaway was to stay adaptable in terms of coding languages, and keep note of use cases for both main types (object vs. function). Keeping a solid conceptual base for both allows for learning and jumping into new languages with just a little study on syntax and idiosyncracies instead of going from the ground up each time.

Run Info: Scheme files run via command line as "scheme < [filename].sch" after installing Scheme to system. Java files run via JVM, done in Eclipse editing environment.
